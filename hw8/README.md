My gragh shows the mean income of females vs the mean income of males in different races (All, White, Hispanic, Black and Asian)
The range of X line and Y line are [20000, 65000], which can inclue all the data in the picture.
The order of race in the plot legend is the order of the pecentage of the races in the U.S. (All, White, Hispanic, Black and Asian)
The star is for all the race, the circle is for a specific race. Using star can differentiate the point of total race.
I choose the distinct color and obvious size for the race points so that the points can be shown clear.
