The plot is clean. The colors chosen are appropriate because we can distinct each element. The graphical elements used are also appropriate because lines can show their trend in different years. The graphical choices allows me to focus on the right elements, which is the trend of each element from 2010 to 2016. The plot honestly reproduces the data, which shows each element performs high between 2012 and 2013.
Improvement: The assignment requires that “choose to plot anything you wish, from the data we used so far”. Please use the data we used in the course before. Please make the title for the picture. Make the description of y line so that I can understand what the number mean in y line. Make the points of 2012 and 2016 in x line.
