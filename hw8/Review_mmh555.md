The plot is clean and easy to read. The graphical elements used are also appropriateÂ because two bars of male and female can show their differences. The graphical choices allows me to focus on the right elements, which is the distribution of top 100 males and females of 2014 and 2015 Marathon. The plot honestly reproduces the data, which shows that fewer people in the top and more people in the bottom, and male runners are quicker than female runners in general.
Improvement: I prefer to use more obvious colors to distinguish male and female. The size of title should be bigger than the descriptions of x line and y line. Please use the data we used in the course before.
