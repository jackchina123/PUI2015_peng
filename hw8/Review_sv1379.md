The plot is clean and easy to read. The colors chosen are appropriate because blue and red are obvious colors. The graphical elements used are also appropriateÂ because two bars of male and female can show their differences. The graphical choices allows me to focus on the right elements, which is the distribution of males and females who are riders in different age. The plot honestly reproduces the data, which shows that male rider are far more than female riders.
Improvement: It is hard to distinguish the female bars in (70, 80] and (80, 90] and distinguish the female and male bars in (80, 90].
