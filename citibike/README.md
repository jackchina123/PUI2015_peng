The idea is to describe among subscribers, people younger than 35 are more likely to take long trips than people older than 35. 
Therefore, we made a null hypothesis, which is the ratio of trips > 30 minutes in the >= 35 age group is higher than or equal to the ratio of trips > 30 minutes in the < 35 age group. 
The alternative hypothesis is that the ratio of trips > 30 minutes in the >= 35 age group is lower to the ratio of trips > 30 minutes in the < 35 age group. 
The confidence level is 95%. 
We use z-score to test.
Because the zscore is too large, we reject the null hypothesis.

I contributed to figure out the z score and make the bar graph for the data. 

We use the bike data from 201504-citibike-tripdata.csv. Because the data is too big so that we cannot upload to github. You can download it from the citibike website.
